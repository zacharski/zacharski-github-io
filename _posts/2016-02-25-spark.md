Before I talk about how to make recommendations using matrix factorization, I need to review dot products. 

A list of numbers, for example, Jake's weights for the features: [-0.37,  2.38] is called a **vector**. A dot product is performed on two vectors of equal length and produces a single value. It is defined as follows:

Let A and B be two vectors of equal length. Then

<div>$$ A \cdot  B = \sum_{i=1}^nA_iB_i=A_1B_1+A_2B_2+A_1B_1+...A_nB_n$$</div>

So above we determined Jake's rating of Taylor Swift by getting the dot product of Jake, *J* and Taylor Swift, *S*:

$$J \cdot  S = -0.37 \times 0.79 +  2.38 \times 2.13 = 4.78$$

And, since I am giving things fancy names in this section,  I am going to call the Table from users to weights of the different features, Matrix P and the table from artists to weight Matrix Q. Once we have P and Q it is easy to make predictions. 

### How do we get Matrices P and Q?

Well we guess. 




math stuff
<div>let $$r_{ij}$$ be the rating user *i* gave to item *j*. </div>


<div>$$\hat{r}_{ij}=p_i^Tq_j=\sum_{k=1}^{k}p_{ik}q_{kj}$$</div>
